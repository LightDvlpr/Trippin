### Running the app

For local development you will need two terminals open, one for the api-backend and another for the react-client.


```bash
# terminal 1 for the api-backend 
cp .env.example .env
npm install
npm run dev
```

```bash
# terminal 2 for react-client 
cd client
npm install
npm start
```

- api-backend will launch at: http://localhost:8080
- react-client will launch at: http://localhost:3000
